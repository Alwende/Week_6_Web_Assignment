# JavaScript Concepts Demonstration Webpage

This project demonstrates the use of fundamental JavaScript concepts as part of an assignment. It includes a functional webpage with:

* **Effective Event Listeners:** JavaScript event listeners are used to handle user interactions.
* **Form Validation:** Client-side validation is implemented to ensure the user provides valid input in the form fields.
* **Interactive Elements:** The webpage features elements that respond to user actions, providing a dynamic experience.

## Instructions

To view and interact with this webpage:

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Alwende/Week_6_Web_Assignment
    ```
    (Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of this project on GitHub)

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-project-directory
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.** You can do this by simply double-clicking the file or by right-clicking and selecting "Open with..." followed by your preferred browser.

## Functionality

The webpage contains a form with the following fields:

* **Name:** A text input field that requires a non-empty value.
* **Email:** An email input field that requires a valid email format.
* **Password:** A password input field that requires a minimum of 8 characters.

The form includes JavaScript validation that provides real-time feedback as you type and prevents submission if the input is invalid. Error messages are displayed next to each field if the validation fails.

Additionally, there is an interactive element:

* A button labeled "Click Me". Clicking this button will change the text content of the paragraph below it.

## Attempting the Instructions

As part of the assignment, I have:

* Read through the instructions (presumably provided separately or within a more detailed `README.md` if this is a simplified version).
* Attempted to implement all the required functionalities using JavaScript.

## Pushing Changes

The code for this webpage has been pushed to this GitHub repository. You can view the source code in the following files:

* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the webpage.
* `style.css`: Contains the CSS styles for the webpage (optional, but included for better presentation).
* `script.js`: Contains the JavaScript code implementing event listeners, form validation, and interactive elements.

Feel free to explore the code to understand how these JavaScript concepts have been applied.
